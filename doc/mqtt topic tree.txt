{ATT
An ATT object is a vehicle-attitude report. It is returned by digital-compass and gyroscope sensors; depending on device, it may include: heading, pitch, roll, yaw, gyroscope, and magnetic-field readings. Because such sensors are often bundled as part of marine-navigation systems, the ATT response may also include water depth.

The "class", "mode", and "tag" fields will reliably be present. Others may be reported or not depending on the specific device type.

Table 5. ATT object

Name	Always?	Type	Description
class	Yes	string	Fixed: "ATT"
tag	Yes	string	Type tag associated with this GPS sentence; from an NMEA device this is just the NMEA sentence type.
device	Yes	string	Name of originating device
time	Yes	numeric	Seconds since the Unix epoch, UTC. May have a fractional part of up to .001sec precision.
heading	No	numeric	Heading, degrees from true north.
mag_st	No	string	Magnetometer status.
pitch	No	numeric	Pitch in degrees.
pitch_st	No	string	Pitch sensor status.
yaw	No	numeric	Yaw in degrees
yaw_st	No	string	Yaw sensor status.
roll	No	numeric	Roll in degrees.
roll_st	No	string	Roll sensor status.
dip	No	numeric	Local magnetic inclination, degrees, positive when the magnetic field points downward (into the Earth).
mag_len	No	numeric	Scalar magnetic field strength.
mag_x	No	numeric	X component of magnetic field strength.
mag_y	No	numeric	Y component of magnetic field strength.
mag_z	No	numeric	Z component of magnetic field strength.
acc_len	No	numeric	Scalar acceleration.
acc_x	No	numeric	X component of acceleration.
acc_y	No	numeric	Y component of acceleration.
acc_z	No	numeric	Z component of acceleration.
gyro_x	No	numeric	X component of acceleration.
gyro_y	No	numeric	Y component of acceleration.
depth	No	numeric	Water depth in meters.
temperature	No	numeric	Temperature at sensor, degrees centigrade.

The heading, pitch, and roll status codes (if present) vary by device. For the TNT Revolution digital compasses, they are coded as follows:

Table 6. Device flags

Code	Description
C	magnetometer calibration alarm
L	low alarm
M	low warning
N	normal
O	high warning
P	high alarm
V	magnetometer voltage level alarm

When the C client library parses a response of this kind, it will assert ATT_IS.

Here's an example:

{"class":"ATT","tag":"PTNTHTM","time":1270938096.843,
    "heading":14223.00,"mag_st":"N",
    "pitch":169.00,"pitch_st":"N", "roll":-43.00,"roll_st":"N",
    "dip":13641.000,"mag_x":2454.000}
